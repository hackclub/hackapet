# Welcome to CompanionOS - by @Briyan Dyju!

Here is a quick how-to for you across the entire program!

## 1 - First things first:
**NOTE: Since this program was made on my device, I request you to please swap out all the directories and locations of the bmp files to your own device's**

## The Launcher:
Use the down arrow key to go between options and use the up arrow key to select an option

## The Dice:
Use the up arrow key to get a random dice face! (More dice options from 3 sides to 20 sides (D20) coming soon!!)

## The Coin:
Use the up arrow key to flip a coin (No animation currently)

## The Cookie Clicker MiniGame:
Use Space to get a score (please ignore screen flickering while I find a fix =(

# Coming Soon Features: (After my exams!):
- More Mini Games!!
- More Dice options like promised! (Already working on it)
- A coin fliping animation
- upgrades and bonuses for the cookie clicker minigame
- A Hackapet pet =)
