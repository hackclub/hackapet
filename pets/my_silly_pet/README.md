a pet with a mii artstyle and background that can be fed and becomes really really sad when not fed for a while 

Press keys[pygame.K_SPACE] to feed the pet!!

UPDATE:

- added a functional hunger bar!!
- redid the background!!
- made the code WAY more efficient!!
- redid the restart screen to make it my own art (its ugly as hell but i like that its mine)
- added an animation for feeding!!!!!
- fixed the hunger timer to go out after exactly 2 weeks!!
