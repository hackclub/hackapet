## wizard pet
ok so you have this little wizard pet who you advise on their way to defeat the evil goblins and beacome a better wizard.
you chose what spell to cast with left/right and up to submit, then target the spell (when necessary), also using left/right
and up to submit, and watch as your little friend casts spells and gets beat up by monsters.

the game is still super unfinished. counter spell just doesn't do anyhing, the attacks aren't well telegraphed, and the game 
just ends when you die. but i programmed this entire thing the day before the deadline with no prior python experience so im 
pretty happy with how it came out. i do plan on finishing it in the future but i just submitted this to get something in before
the deadline :)
